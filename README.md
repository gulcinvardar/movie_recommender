# A Movie Recommender Web-App based on an NMF model, a user-similarity model, or a random selection

This project was written during Spiced Academy Data Science Bootcamp. 
It is one of the weekly projects.

This is a web-app using Flask. The main page asks the user to select from:
- Random recommendation (I am feeling lucky)
- NMF model (I want a good guess)
- User-similarity (What do people like me watch?)

The user can select the year and genre preference for the movie recommendation:
- Year: Before 2000, After 2000
- Genre: Is given as the list documented in the movie-info




# Ideas for further development:

Save the user and keep track of their rating 
Use IMDB API
